               <h2>Ideation: Objectives and Outcomes</h2>

<p>The first step in your journey towards the implementation of the Capstone project begins with an idea. In this module you will develop the idea for your project, the set of expected features, survey the market to look at similar ideas to enable you to differentiate your project from others, while at the same time drawing inspiration from them. You are required to submit a formal ideation report following the structure given in the template. This will enable your peers to provide you feedback and suggestions for your project.

Before you get started on a project, the first step is to develop the idea for the project. In this module you will explore how you develop your idea and come up with possible set of features for your project. At the end of this step you should be able to:

    Clearly express the central idea of your project, and identify the problem being addressed
    Delineate a set of features that you expect your website and app should support
    Identify other projects that might have similar features and would act as exemplars for your project</p>

                <h2>UI Design and Prototyping: Objectives and Outcomes</h2>

<p>Now that you are more clear about your project idea, it's time to conceive how your project is going to look like for the end-users. This is the time to design the user interface and the flow of your application. User interface design and prototyping helps you to conceptualize the look and feel of your application. This can be achieved in two ways: using wireframe diagrams, or using prototyping tools. We provide links to wireframing and prototyping tools in the additional resources. The focus in this lesson is to be able to visually represent various UI elements to enable designing your application. The aim is to deliver an reasonable representation of the end-user experience with your application At the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

    Construct a wireframe diagram to visually represent the structure of your user interface
    Construct a prototype to enable understanding the flow of your application</p>

                <h2>Project Implementation: Objectives and Outcomes</h2>

<p>This is the final stretch before you complete your project. By this time you should already have a good scaffolding for your website. As you flesh out your project and race towards completion, it is time to pause and take stock of the current situation. Perhaps a critical look back at the past, with the view of learning from our experience and consolidating this learning into an effective, organized and repeatable process is in order. Upon completion of the project it is important not only to demonstrate the working project, but also summarize the process of reaching the final goal. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

    Document the process of starting from an idea and reaching the conclusion of the project, not just the implementation, but also recognizing the process of reaching the end.
    Learn lessons from the process in understanding what worked and what did not, and being able to make intelligent choices in the future based on the experience
    Understand the design and development process through the practice.</p>
